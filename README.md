Copy an existing C++ project folder into an existing GitHub repository:

Clone the repository: Use the git clone command to download the existing GitHub repository to your local machine. Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL of your repository.
>> git clone <repository_url>

Copy project files: Copy the contents of your existing C++ project folder into the cloned repository directory.

Stage changes: Use the git add command to stage the copied files for commit. The . specifies that all changes in the current directory should be staged.
>> git add .

Commit changes: Use the git commit command to commit the staged changes with a descriptive message.
>> git commit -m "Add existing C++ project"

Push changes: Use the git push command to upload the committed changes to the remote GitHub repository. 
>> git push origin main

Note: If your main branch is named differently (e.g., master), replace main with the appropriate branch name.
